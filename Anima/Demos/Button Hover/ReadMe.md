Note: In both the examples you get a sort of flickering. 
When I wrote it I thought this was my screen but then I realised that it was not my screen
but some faulty algorithm that I used. So if you figure out how to do the same using anima
without flickering please mail me or yeah this is in Github so feel free to fork it - make changes
and report the changes made to me. This way you will help not just in the development of Anima but
also many Love2D game programmers who badly need some cutscenes/keyframe animations or even very
simple animations in their game but don't want to do some extra work for it and make their code humongous
