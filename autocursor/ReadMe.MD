# autoCursor

autoCursor is a straight-forward artificial mouse-input-handling module for the beloved LÖVE framework which allows many cool features such as making the cursor _follow_ a particular position rather than jumping from one position to another and of course *that's not all*.

### Context (can Skip)

Sometimes - when developing games with AI - you want the AI-agent to move the mouse on its own (maybe in board-games like chess,tic-tac-toe,etc where such actions adds to the illusion that another player is playing with the user so-to-speak).
You can achieve that by using ```love.mouse:setPosition``` but the problem is that it would appear very fake because the cursor is not _moving_ to a position rather _jumping_ to a position. So would it not be nice if you had a framework whose sole purpose-in-life was to achieve that functionality in LÖVE2D allowing you to make the mouse follow to a particular position with other features such as changing the speed at which mouse follows a position or automatically clicking mouse when the cursor has reached the position, etc.

## Usage

```lua
acursor = require 'autoCursor'
```

### Setting the Destination Point

```setDestination(x,y)``` sets the destination point (x,y) which the cursor follows

Now try running the following example:-

```lua
function love.load()
    acursor:setDestination(200,200)
    --so here the destination point is (200,200)
end

function love.update(dt)
    acursor:update()
end
```

### Changing the speed

```acursor:update``` accepts two parameters ```dx``` and ```dy``` which you can think of as the speed. By default it is 1 pixel/frame but you can set it to something else. This is especially useful when you want to move the cursor diagonally but the distance to cover is unsymmetric (different for x and y).

Try this in the previous example:

```lua
    acursor:update(5,5)
```

### Changing the Source Point

Note that source point is by default (0,0) however you can change it to some other value using ```setPosition(x,y)```

In our example you may want to add the following to ```love.load()```
```lua
    acursor:setPosition(400,400)
```

### Automatically clicking when destination is reached

You can set automatic clicking such that when a destination is reached autoCursor will automatically trigger a mouse click. The question you need to ask yourself before setting automatic clicking is - *Do you want to click at the destination point or at a different point?* depending on that you may want to use either of ```clickOnReachingDest(mousebtn,isTouch)``` or ```clickPointOnDest(x,ymousebtn,isTouch) ```

In our example you may want to add the following to ```love.load()```
```lua
    acursor:clickOnReachingDest()
```
The default arguments are ```mousebtn==1``` and ```isTouch=false```. So what this will do is left-click the destination point on reaching the destination point

### Enable Dragging

You can enable automatic dragging such that LMB is pressed every time the current mouse position is changed and that would give a smooth effect of dragging.

```lua
    acursor:enableDragging()
```

If you want to turn off dragging then you can simple pass some falsy value in the argument

### Other functions

```lua
    acursor:destinationReached()
	--checks to see whether cursor has reached the destination point 

	acursor:reset()
	--resets everything to default, saves you from re-requiring to get default values

	acursor:getPosition()
	--gets the current artificial cursor position

	acursor:getX()
	--gets the current artificial cursor x co-ordinate

	acursor:getY()
	--gets the current artificial cursor y co-ordinate
```
