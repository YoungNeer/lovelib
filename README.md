## A quick Introduction to lovelib

LoveLib is home to either WIP libraries or the ones that perhaps don't deserve their own repository. 

## So what is lovelib
For starters lovelib is a collection of libraries not a library itself. If you want to see what these tiny libraries can do then head on to each one of these "sub-repositories" i mean folders. First head on to flare then Anima.


## Help Needed?
As I said some of these libraries are WIP - like Anima and autoCursor. And possibly I can't do this alone - well I could but that would be not worth it. So I encourage contributions
