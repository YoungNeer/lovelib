## A quick Introduction to lovelib

How would you react if I tell you that in just three lines of code*?

*Three lines of Anima code (the boiler-plate code, the lines required for table init, etc are not counted as they can vary from person to person)
  
## So what is lovelib
For starters lovelib is a collection of libraries not a library itself. All of my libraries go here (along with lovecc and Anima). If you want to see what these tiny libraries can do then head on to each one of these "sub-repositories" i mean folders. First head on to Anima.
